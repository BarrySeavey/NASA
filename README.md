 This was a project for PRED455 (Data Visualization) in my Northwestern MS in Predictive Analytics class.
 Our project topic was NASA.
#
 Viz stuff was done mostly in Tableau (at least where things like bar charts & maps were done) & final editing done in InkScape 
  (freeware software - basically an Adobe Illustrator knockoff from what I can tell).
